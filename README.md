Hi, I'm Bear known as N6REJ in the ham radio circles. 

I started with @github due to my love of Joomla! & working with the Joomla bug squad in hammering out issues within the code. 

Through the years I've started using github for all my coding projects now & have come to enjoy it. 

I work alot with  [Abivia](http://abivia.com "Abivia") &  [AM Graphix](https://am-graphix.com/ "AM Graphix").

My favorite tools, organizations and projects are...

![@joomla](https://cdn.joomla.org/images/Joomla_logo.png "Joomla!") Joomla! 

![AM Graphix](https://am-graphix.com/images/sitegraphix/AMGLogo2012.png "Am Graphix")
![@browserstack](https://d2ogrdw2mh0rsl.cloudfront.net/production/images/static/header/header-logo.svg "Browserstack")

![NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/images_www/v7/design/logo_netbeans_red.png)

![Bootstrap](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7NyxmdySDOo/WNGVHiAJ2GI/AAAAAAAAiT8/t_GR17h1N40ZNhoCX9AJHy8E6Ib-CMPdgCLcB/s0/bootstrap-logo.jpg "bootstrap-logo.jpg")

I firmly believe in ***FOSS*** 
I love helping people and finding bugs & then fixing them in things that I use.
I'm also a avid photographer, lover of country living, & Christian.
