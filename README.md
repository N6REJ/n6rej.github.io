Hi, I'm Bear known as N6REJ in the ham radio circles. I started with github due to my love of Joomla! & working with the Joomla bug squad in hammering out issues within the code. Through the years I've started using github for all my coding projects now & have come to enjoy it. I work alot with

### Software, tools & projects I enjoy:

Hi folks. For those that create Joomla! modules I've created an automatic packager. You can see what it creates here

![](https://github.com/.../mod.../releases/tag/2025.06.13.1)

All that is required for you to use it is to deposit the package-module.yml file, in your .github/workflows folder https://github.com/.../.github/workflows/package-module.yml and change just a few lines of code at the top of the file, which is well notated.

## ðŸ“„ Extended Documentation

For a full guide to all Joomla extension packager workflows (modules, plugins, components, and multi-extension packages), see the [Joomla Packager Workflows Documentation](https://hallhome.us/software/packager-documentation). This page covers:
- How each workflow works
- How to configure and use them
- Environment variables and customization
- Best practices and troubleshooting

I hope this helps others. I'm the creator so ofc I find it fantastic. Contact me if you have any questions or issues.
